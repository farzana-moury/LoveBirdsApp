## Planning
Wedding task management involves creating tasks, assigning tasks (individual, collective), deleting tasks, and editing tasks. Couples can also sort by individual tasks, collective tasks and budget tasks.

## Guest List
A list that contains all of the guests that are to arrive. The couple can add however many guests they choose. Adding a guest requires the following guest information:
* Guest Name
* Phone Number
* Email
* Description - the couple can put any specific notes regarding the guest they are inviting
* RSVP - Once the guest is invited they will be sent an email with an accept button. When the guest clicks accept they will be redirected to our website to be confirmed as a coming guest

## Vendors
Couples are able to view vendors in a user-specified location according to predefined categories (Venues, Bridal Gowns, Photographers, Florists, Gifts).

## Invite your spouse
When a user first creates their account,they can send an invitation to their significant other and add them as a collaborator to their list.
1. When the user sends an invitation for their partner, their partner will receive an email with an accept button.
2. When the invited user accepts the request they will be forwarded to the website to login and replace their old list with the new one (the user who sent the invitation list)

## Account Registration
A simple account registration form so user can log in later with a password and email, allowing them to save wedding plan data via API such that they can access their data in the app and the web.
